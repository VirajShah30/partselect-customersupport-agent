The latch assembly is connected by two wiring harnesses that are nearly identical, so it is recommended to make note of where each harness goes before continuing with the repair. You will need a Torx screwdriver to complete the repair. Disconnect the dishwasher from the power source before beginning this repair."

The timer is responsible for ensuring the various parts of the dishwasher cycle activate at the correct time. If the timer is in any way broken or faulty, it will cause your dishwasher to not start, take longer than normal or finish too early, and will need to be replaced as soon as possible. This timer features a mostly metal construction and features a wire terminal on its top side. Replacing this timer will require a few tools, like a screwdriver or socket wrench, and some disassembly of your dishwasher will be necessary.
