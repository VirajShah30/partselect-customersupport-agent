This module features an LED light panel that is secured to the top portion of your refrigerator cabinet and shines light down when you open the appliance. If your current LED light is not turning on and/or is flickering or working intermittently, it needs to be replaced. Replacing this LED light panel is simple as it features a single power cable harness that connects inside your fridge, and a single screw to secure it. This LED light panel is sold individually and does not come with any other parts, such as its securing screw."

The mullion acts as a barrier between the refrigerator and freezer to maintain the desired temperatures for each section. A damaged or loose hinge pin will result in temperature fluctuations, frost buildup along the door edges, and difficulties opening and closing the door. Therefore, it is important that you replace the pin as soon as it is no longer functioning. Note that your appliance may require two hinge pins, one near the top of the mullion and one near the bottom. Remove the mullion cover, detach the hinge pin, and install a the new one into the hinge assembly. Place the cover back on and verify that the hinge assembly is working by carefully opening and closing the refrigerator doors to check that they are moving smoothly. Each sold individually."

It can be located in either the freezer compartment near the evaporator coils or in the fresh food compartment near the airflow channels, depending on the model. If you notice issues like excessive icing in the freezer, inadequate cooling in the refrigerator, temperature fluctuations, or error messages on the display panel, it indicates a potential problem with the thermistor. Since your fridge will not be able to maintain the desired temperature, this results in food spoilage, inefficient cooling, and potential damage to the cooling components. To replace the thermistor, disconnect it from the connector plug or wiring harness and remove any mounting brackets or clips using a screwdriver if necessary. Remember to consult your user manual to determine the required number of thermistors, as they are sold individually as OEM replacement parts."

This allows the defrost circuit to clear the evaporator of ice or frost to maintain proper airflow. The defrost timer is located in the control housing which is in the refrigerator section of your appliance. If this part is not working, it can lead to temperature increases in your refrigerator. If the compressor circuit fails, no cooling will take place; if the defrost circuit isn't activated, ice will quickly build up on the evaporator coils and reduce airflow and efficiency. If the timer doesn't advance or if the contacts have no continuity, the timer will need to be replaced. This timer measures approximately 3 inches long and 2.5 inches wide, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in black/white/silver and is sold individually. This replacement part features 1 defrost timer."

It is a two-piece dish that is used to grill or cook food while the broil function is on, meaning it can withstand high temperatures. This set includes both the pan and the grid. The grid is the top part. The slotted design allows grease to easily drip into to the pan below. Not only does it catch all of the drippings, it also prevents splatter and smoke while cooking. The pan can also be used separately for baking and roasting. This cookware features a durable porcelain finish, which means it is incredibly easy to clean, and is dishwasher safe. It is roughly 1.5 inches deep, and measures approximately 16.5 inches by 12.5 inches. If your two-piece broil plan is lost, rusted, or damaged this is the replacement you need."
